            <p>I grew up in Downeast Maine, the upper part of the coast that is named for the way in which sailors had to navigate to get there. I've heard that, because of the default seabreeze in the Gulf of Maine, sailors need to sail down wind and eastward to reach the special rocky coastline that is my hometown. In Downeast is the famous Acadia National Park. I love my homeland for many reasons, but the fresh seafood is definitely one of the top reasons. Me and my siblings can pick fresh mussels, dig for fresh clams, or catch fresh fish any day. Since my neighbor is a lobsterman, we get good deals on lobsters. The main thing I don't love about Maine is how cold the winters are and how few job opportunities there are.</p>

            <p>I drove out west nearly three years ago when I decided I wanted to experience a different region of the country. When I visited, I immediately loved how verdant Portland is, even in the winter. I also loved all of the opportunities to meet people my age with my interests. Since moving to Portland,I have worked as a babysitter and a neuroscientist. I feel very landlocked being 1.5 hours from the ocean, but I am enjoying all of the moss and tall trees. </p>
